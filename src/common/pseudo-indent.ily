%%%%%%%% PSEUDOINDENT FUNCTIONS %%%%%%%%

% these two functions are for indenting individual systems
% - to left-indent a system, apply \pseudoIndent before the music continues
% - \pseudoIndents is similar, but lets you also indent on the right
% - both provide an option for changing that system's instrument names

% N.B. these functions
% - assume application to non-ragged lines (generally the default)
% - include a manual \break to ensure application at line start
% - misbehave if called more than once at the same line start

% the parameters of the (full) pseudoIndents function are:
% 1: name-tweaks
%      usually omitted; accepts replacement \markup for instrument names
%      as an ordered list; starred elements leave their i-names unchanged.
% 2: left-indent
%      additional left-indentation, in staff-space units; can be negative,
%      but avoid a total indentation which implies (unsupported) stretching.
% 3: right-indent
%      amount of right-indentation, in staff-space units; can be negative.
%      - not offered by the (reduced) pseudoIndent function

% [2] versions >=2.19.16: the first system behaves differently from the rest

% [3] versions >=2.23.0: LeftEdge's position may well differ in Y (but not in X)
