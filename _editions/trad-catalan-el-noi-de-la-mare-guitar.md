## Edition notes
The song is traditional Catalan, sung as a lullaby and as a Christmas Nativity carol.

```
Què li darem a n'el Noi de la Mare?
Què li darem que li sàpiga bo?
Panses i figues i nous i olives,
Panses i figues i mel i mató.
```

```
What will we give to the son of the Mother?
What will we give him that's tasty and good?
Raisins and figs and walnuts and olives,
Raisins and figs and honey and curd.
```

In my version, I've added a short intro, which also gets echoed at the very end. The 3rd and 4th lines of each verse are repeated. The first couple of verses are accompanied by broken chords, then after a key change there is a bit more horizontal movement, before finally thining out to a sparser texture.



## Guitar versions of El Noi de la Mare

### Miguel Llobet
The most well known setting of _El Noi de la Mare_ for classical guitar is by Miguel Llobet, one of his _Cançons Popular Catalanes_. It has been widely published, sometimes with slight variants.

### Some other published versions

Here's list of some other versions for solo classical guitar (certainly not exhaustive, but it might be a useful enough resource). Some are clearly derived to some extent from the Llobet version. Most take a relatively straightforward approach, a harmonized accompaniment to the melody; one or two included here are more like original works, using the tune as a theme and point of depature.

For time signature, some are notated in 3/4, others in 6/8. Of these, some have an anacrusis so the 4th note of the melody falls on the stressed first beat of the bar. This is how the tune appears in an early written version, from an organ freestyle notebook of around 1820, preserved in the [Chapter Archive of Lleida Cathedral](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arxiu_Capitular_de_Lleida) (see the bottom of image on the [El Noi de la Mare Wikipedia entry](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_noi_de_la_mare), titled _Mañaguet de la Mare_).
