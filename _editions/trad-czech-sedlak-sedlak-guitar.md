## Edition notes
Here is a little Christmas project of mine - a guitar arrangement of this old Czech tune, that I previously knew only as the Zither Carol. Doing a bit of searching, I learnt that the 19th century Czech folklorist Karel Jaromír Erben included the song 'Sedlák, sedlák' in his collection *Prostonárodní české písně a říkadla* ('Czech Folk Songs and Nursery Rhymes').

It was set with English words by Malcolm Sargent for his Zither Carol ('*Girls and boys, leave your toys, make no noise*'), which appeared in the first book of *Carols for Choirs* in 1961. I remember first singing the carol in primary school in the UK, when it featured on the BBC radio program for schools *Singing Together*.

With *Sedlák* meaning 'peasant farmer' (according to Google Translate), the sentiment of the words seems light-hearted and frolicsome, gently poking fun at a corpulent farmer:

```
Farmer, farmer, farmer, once again farmer,
farmer, farmer, farmer, he is a big man:
he has a girdle on his belly,
and on his coat a tulip.
```

The tune is also quoted in Bedřich Smetana's comic opera *The Bartered Bride* [(Act 2 - *Furiant*)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UEm-zuEzCs).

The furiant is a fast Bohemian dance with metre shifting between duple and triple time. In my arrangement here I've added my own intro, break and middle-eight sections, and I've tried to incorporate some lively textures and varied sonorities for contrast. The repeats are in AABB form, which diverges from the Zither Carol, but is perhaps more how the tune would have been danced.
