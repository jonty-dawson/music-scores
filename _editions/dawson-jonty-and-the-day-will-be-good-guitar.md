This started life as a half-written song from a few years back. I recently worked it up into this solo guitar piece. It retains the song structure (intro - verse - chorus, then a central slower bridge-like section, before a recap of the verse/chorus and an outro), but I've tried to give it a more expansive feel, taken at a slower pace.
