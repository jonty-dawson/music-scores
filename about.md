Greetings from Scotland!

I play guitar as a hobby, and occasionally make transcriptions of pieces that I'm interested in learning. I've made the sheet music available on this site, along with some brief explanations about each edition.

I use LilyPond for typesetting the music - it creates good-looking output, and can deal with guitar notation such as fingering markings and barr√© positions. LilyPond uses text-based input, which makes version control simple - you can find the source files for the editions in my [music-scores GitHub repository](https://github.com/jonty-dawson/music-scores){:data-goatcounter-click="about-src-github"}.
